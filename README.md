Hello there!

I currently struggling with bootstrap-carousel.

goto index.html
line no -> 114 to 134 { here the carousel is working perfectly }

now goto line no -> 92 to 113 { here the carousel is not working}

I tried different browser's, different online bootstrap-compilers, different ways of connecting bootstrap to my project.

Nothing has worked for me 

If anyone can solve this issue it would be of great help.

I have included all the files

And one more thing can anyone provide all the link for connecting bootstrap { latest version and in correct order }

I am newbie and i tried my best to convey my problem.
